A list of cool and useful ideas of evolution :

____________________
I - History (l.1936)

 → size should be limited (on the current version it is not)

 → clicking should interrupt the 'duplication prevention' mechanism
   example:
   * when I type 'azertyuiiop'
   * then click somewhere else
   * then type 'azertyfdsq'
   * then perform an undo (ctrl-z)
   * poof! both strings are deleted.
   This could be a solution :
      the property 'lastKey' of the editor should be reset 
      at 'null' on each click. (fixed this l.78 & l.127)

 → if cozy-notes integrates icons for the functions undo and redo,
   these buttons can be activated/deactivated thanks to the methods
   undoPossible() and redoPossible()
   (they return true only if undo/redo can be called)
   note: it may be more simple if these informations were given by properties
         rather than methods...


_________________
II - Save (l.512)

 → the shortcut Ctrl-s makes the element nesting the editor 
   fire an event 'saveRequest' so cozy-notes can save the note.
   cozy-notes doesnt do it yet !


____________________
III - Paste (l.2077)

 → in the current version, a ctrl-v only fetches the clipboard's content
   this content should be cleaned (see beautify.js) then this cleaned html
   should be parsed (I started to think about this parsing, see l.2351 in 
   source code)

   → first step : parse the html string and convert it into our format

   → second step : restitute the initial structure by giving pasted content
     appropriate indentation and classes

 → another good idea: convert clipboard content to markdown, then turn it back
   into our own format.


___________________________
IV - firstLine, deepestLine

 → a pointer to the first line of the editor should be upkeeped

 → for automatic styles, the maximal depth should be upkeeped too


__________________________________
V - linemotion management (l.1634)

 → choose a behavior when re-inserting the swapped line


_________________________
VI - autosummary (l.2049)

 → beware, the summary must not "nav" as an id or firefox(v.13+) will add 
   an odd style to it


_____________
And beyond...

 → the library pagedown can replace showdown 
   (just in case showdown is not sufficient)

 → for hotkeys management see jquery.hotkeys.js or keymaster.js

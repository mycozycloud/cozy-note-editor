A list of nasty bugs that should (and will) disappear

 → BUG: when performing a _return or a _backspace on an empty line
   this bug has appeared since the modification of normalization done to assure
   compatibility under Google chrome
   I tried to correct it with the flag property 'isEmptyLine' but i seem to 
   have failed x(

 → when double-clicking on the end of a line, the range obtained is like
   startContainer = BODY
   endContainer = BODY
   and the offets correspond to the div which was doubleclicked
   Many functions did not consider this situation so i tried to fix it
     (see example in source code l.615)
   However I think it's fine to keep that issue in mind for further bugs :-)

 
 → in the linemotion functions (l.1628), behavior should be special when moving
   the first line down, or the second line up. I started to code something but 
   it's not a good solution (l.1835)
     > as a solution I think about adding an ivisible 'sentinel line' before the
       first line of the editor, so the rest of the code still works for the 
       second line.
     

 → about the md2cozy converter (l.2269) :
   translation fails around l.19 in the example file 
   './templates/content-shortlines-marker'
   and this is annoying :s

 → when doing Shift-left at the beginning of a line, the browser only selects 
   the br of the previous line (this shortcut should be controlled, as well
   as Shift-right/left/up/pgDwn/pgUp/end/home... controlled or prevented :-) )
